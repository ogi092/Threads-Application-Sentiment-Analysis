# Threads Application Sentiment Analysis
## Introduction
In a digital era filled with text data from various sources such as social media, product reviews, and user comments, sentiment analysis has become increasingly important to understand people's views and feelings on certain topics. This project aims to extract insights from text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) techniques, especially Long Short-Term Memory ( LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).

Through this approach, this project will help understand the opinions or sentiments contained in the text data at hand. By classifying sentiment into positive, negative, or neutral, this analysis will provide valuable insight into how the public responds to certain topics or products.

## Main feature
This project offers several sentiment analysis and classification features, including:

- **Sentiment Distribution Analysis:** Understanding how sentiment is distributed in a dataset.
- **Textual Exploration:** Analyze text characteristics to understand context and sentiment tendencies.
- **Use of ANN:** Application of LSTM and RNN models for sentiment classification.

## Methodology
The project methodology is divided into several main stages:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform visualization and statistical analysis to understand text data characteristics and sentiment distribution.
- **Textual Processing and Feature Engineering:** Process text to make it ready for use in ANN models, including text vectorization and word embedding.
- **ANN Model Training and Evaluation:** Using LSTM and RNN models for sentiment classification, followed by model performance evaluation.

## Results
The developed model succeeded in classifying text sentiment with satisfactory accuracy, demonstrating the model's ability to understand and predict sentiment from text data. Model evaluation emphasizes the effectiveness of NLP techniques and ANN models in sentiment analysis.
